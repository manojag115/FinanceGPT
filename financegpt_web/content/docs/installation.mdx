# Installing FinanceGPT

There are two ways to install FinanceGPT, but both require the repository to be cloned first. Clone [FinanceGPT](https://github.com/MODSetter/FinanceGPT) and then:

## Docker Installation 

This method provides a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-configured. Less Customization.

## Manual Installation (Preferred)

For users who prefer more control over the installation process or need to customize their setup, we also provide manual installation instructions.
